## a single-file fallback website

SSGs are a lot of fun, but every now and then I'm stuck updating a JS framework, the SSG itself, or the CMS I use before I can even get the thing to build. This is par for the course in modern webdev, but it feels especially important right now to just have a very very simple single-page site. 

This website runs off a single HTML file, and can be updated by pushing hardcoded changes to the remote repo.

The CSS is all stored in the `<head>` element.
